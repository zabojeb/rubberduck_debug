This is a rubber duck.

Have you ever been stuck while coding and just needed someone to talk to? 
Introducing Rubber Duck Debugging!
This script provides you with a virtual rubber duck to explain your code to.
Sometimes, just articulating the problem can help you see the solution...

## How to Use
1. Run the script in your terminal.
2. Explain your code to your virtual-rubber-duck-bro.
3. Get interesting and encouraging responses.

You can also add this script to your .bash_profile to make the debugging process more ✨aesthetic✨

## Commands
- Type your code-related queries and explanations.
- Type `bye` to exit the debugging session.

## Contributing
If you have creative ideas for new duck responses, feel free to contribute! I'd like all the ideas!

### To-Do-List
- Evil Duck mode
- Add russian Language and russian version of README
- Do something interesting (?)
